The holidays are just around the corner, and if you’re looking for the perfect gift, many local bakeries and shops offer delectable treats that can be wrapped and saved for just the right moment. Even better, these treats are sold year-round, so you don’t need to worry about stocking up (though they certainly make great stocking stuffers).

Here are five locally made goodies your family and friends are sure to love—plus a bonus treat for your furry family members.

## Doughnuts by Plant Cakes Bake Shop

Based in Wake Forest, [Plant Cakes Bake Shop](https://www.plantcakesbakeshop.com/) distinguishes itself as the first all-vegan, animal-product-free bakery in the region. The treats here are dairy-free, egg-free, and plant-based, making this bakery one of the best options for customers with dietary sensitivities, intolerances, and allergies. Plant Cakes offers many kinds of treats, but the vegan and gluten-free doughnuts are the standout giftable goodies. Doughnuts are available for order in person or online, either individually or by the half or full dozen.

## Macarons by Little Blue Macaron

From international education in Texas to pastries in North Carolina, [Little Blue Macaron](https://www.littlebluemacaron.com/) owner Allison Vick has had quite an interesting career. Unlike the other gems on this list, Little Blue Macaron offers only one type of treat: the titular macaron. But while the menu may not have the same variety of baked goods, it more than makes up for it in the quality, flavor, and presentation of the compact French confection. There are standard favorites such as Browned Butter Vanilla and Dark Chocolate, but also the occasional character-themed macarons based on films such as Wicked and Dogman. Or try one of the seasonal specials like Watermelon or the unique Hot Tomato Summer macaron, made of a vanilla shell filled with a ring of basil white chocolate ganache and Duke’s mayo, with a center of bacon and North Carolina heirloom tomato jam. To top it all off, the bakery also offers vegan macarons. These treats can be found in person at Raleigh’s Little Blue Bakehouse or several vendors around town.

## Artie Bars by Artie Bars

Made in Raleigh by husband-and-wife team Artie and Nicole Januario, an [Artie Bar](https://artiebars.com/) is nearly half a pound of handmade millionaire shortbread cookie bars. Baked in small batches, the Original Artie Bar consists of a layer of rich chocolate ganache, a layer of gooey caramel, and a final layer of buttery shortbread cookie. Artie Bars have seven flavors in addition to the original, plus a gluten-free bar. If one isn’t enough, they also come in a set of four bestselling bars or a bundle with two bars and a handcrafted wood-wick cocoa-scented candle from fellow small business Sow and Glo. Artie Bars can be found in several coffee shops and locations around Raleigh or ordered online and shipped to any of the 48 contiguous states.

## Vegan Snickerdoodle Creme Pie by JP’s Pastry

With locations in Benson, Greenville, and now in Raleigh, [JP’s Pastry](http://jpspastry.com/) is a hidden gem to watch in the Triangle. Owner and baker Joe “JP” Parker is making a name for himself—particularly in the gluten-free community—with his wide variety of gluten-free goods and meals. One such treat is the Vegan Snickerdoodle Creme Pie, filled with vegan vanilla buttercream frosting. The Creme Pie is gluten-free, dairy-free, egg-free, and soy-free, and can either be purchased in store or ordered online in packs of four for nationwide shipping. Other goods can be found in Whole Foods Market locations, independent groceries, and other locations.

## Chunky Cookies by Groovy Duck Bakery

Raleigh-based [Groovy Duck Bakery](http://groovyduckbakery.com/) has been a sweet treats staple since its establishment in 2012. The bakery carries all kinds of flavors of fresh-baked muffins and cupcakes as well as bars, custom cakes, and seasonal specials, but it’s the Chunky Cookies that have customers coming back for more. Each cookie has a thick but crisp outside with a gooey inside, bursting (or sometimes oozing) with flavors ranging from the standard chocolate chip to Nutella, red velvet, Biscoff, and more. Customers can purchase cookies individually or in boxes, either by shopping in person or ordering online for in-store pickup. NOTE: Online orders require three business days’ prep time.

## Dog and Cat Treats by Handsome Hound Dog Treats

Durham-based [Handsome Hound Dog Treats](http://handsomehounddogtreats.com/) was launched in 2021 by Susan Graff, who started baking pet treats as a fundraiser to support the staff of her pet-sitting business during Covid lockdown. All treats are preservative-free and baked in Graff’s kitchen. Treats are available for both dogs and cats, and can be purchased online with free delivery within the city limits of Durham. Ten percent of all proceeds made from treat sales go to local animal rescue organizations, with Triangle Beagle Rescue as the designated recipient through the end of 2025.
